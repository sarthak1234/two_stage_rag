       " \"Serverless Developer Guide\\nIdentifying serverless scenarios\\nRevised: 2023-08-22\\nWe see customers regularly building these types of solutions:\\n•Asynchronous data processing– big data processing, image/video manipulation, web hooks\\n•Synchronous interactions – web apps, web services, microservices, web hooks\\n•Streaming  – processing inbound data streams, from apps, IoT devices\\nSolutions can be built with many services, but for each of these scenarios certain services are more \\nfrequently encountered. Use this to page to focus on which services will be essential for you to \\nlearn.\\nAsynchronous data processing\\nServerless allows you to ingest, process and analyze high volumes of data quickly and eﬃciently.\\nAs the volume of data grows, coming from increasingly diverse sources, organizations ﬁnd they \\nneed to move quickly to process this data to ensure they make faster, well-informed business \\ndecisions. To process data at scale, organizations need to elastically provision resources to manage \\nthe information they receive from mobile devices, applications, satellites, marketing and sales, \\noperational data stores, infrastructure, and more.\\nLearn how to build a scalable serverless data processing solution. Use Amazon Simple Storage \\nService to trigger data processing or load machine learning (ML) models so that AWS Lambda can \\nperform ML inference in real time.\\nExamples:\\n•File processing – Suppose you have a photo sharing application. People use your application \\nto upload photos, and the application stores these user photos in an Amazon S3 bucket. Then, \\nyour application creates a thumbnail version of each user's photos and displays them on the \\nuser's proﬁle page. In this scenario, you may choose to create a Lambda function that creates a \\nthumbnail automatically. Amazon S3 is one of the supported AWS event sources that can publish\\nobject-created events  and invoke your Lambda function. Your Lambda function code can read the \\nphoto object from the Amazon S3 bucket, create a thumbnail version, and then save it in another \\nAmazon S3 bucket.\\nAsynchronous data processing 5\"]"
